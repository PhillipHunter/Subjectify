# Subjectify #
----------

**Subjectify allows you to automatically append a term/phrase to the end of search engine queries.**

Subjectify is useful when working on projects where you constantly add either a programming language, framework, software, or other subject to the end of numerous search queries. 
By appending any subject to searches for you, Subjectify saves the tedious hassle of re-typing the same phrase constantly.
